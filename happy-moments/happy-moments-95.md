Today is the first day of 2016! I stayed up till 7 AM last night chatting with my family and cousin. I'm ready for the year.

I went to DC today to go Ice Skating with Ally! Then we went to the natural history museum to look at the gems :) The exhibit looks so much different now -- they really added to it.
